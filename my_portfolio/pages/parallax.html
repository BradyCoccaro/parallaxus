	<div style="height:200px;background-color:black;font-size:26px; color:white; text-align:center; padding-top: 50px; ">Dinosaurs. You've seen them... kind of... And you may or may not like them. But too bad, you're on this site now, no going back. So you've probably seen Jurassic Park, or any of the other millions of dinosaur movies. Well they're all wrong. The dinosaurs in them are wrong, very scientifically and rationally WRONG.   So, you want to know what they ACTUALLLY looked like? Well dear God, you're in for a wild ride... Kind of. </div>

	<div style="height:200px;background-color:black;font-size:26px; color:white; text-align:center; padding-top: 50px">Spinosaurus. You've may have seen it in Jurassic Park III... and that verson of it is wildly wrong. The real thing was more crocodilian than a bipedal bird with a half cirlce on it's back. It was quadrupedal, with a tail similar to that of a modern alligator or crocodile, except thiccer and longer. The sail is also hypothesized to have a dip in the center of it, because why not. I like this version of this dinosaur better honestly.</div>

	<div style="height:200px;background-color:black;font-size:26px; color:white; text-align:center; padding-top: 50px">Sawblade Shark. Helicoprion was a shark-like acquatic creature... that had one weird jaw. It is depicted differently by different people. Some show the lower jaw being like a table saw, and other draw it like a grotesquely long jaw that curved in on itself. The first one is what is more accepted. If this thing was still alive, I wouldn't go near the ocean... more than I already avoid it (crabs scare me.)</div>

	<div style="height:200px;background-color:black;font-size:26px; color:white; text-align:center; padding-top: 50px">Elephant but awesome. Platybelodon was an ancestor of the modern elephant, and it was a mistake. It was smaller than current elephants, but otherwise looked the same... besides it's lower jaw. What is it with prehistoric animals and their messed up lower jaws? It's lower jaw looks like a giant shovel with some teeth. I hate this thing.</div>
	
	<div class="parallax5"></div>
	
	<div style="height:200px;background-color:black;font-size:26px; color:white; text-align:center; padding-top: 50px">Carnotaurus. Name literally means Carnivorous Bull, which fits I guess. If you've seen Disney's 'Dinosaur' before, then you might have seen this in that movie. And if you're like me, you probably have nightmares from it. The real thing, however, wasn't super terrifying. It was pretty much a giant bird with two horns, and albiet the cassowary is a way cooler bird with horns. All in all, the Carnotaurus looks like it would be named Todd.  </div>
